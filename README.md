# Secure-File-Sharing-Vault

## Description

This desktop application allows users to share files in an end-to-end encrypted manner using hybrid cryptography. Files are sliced into several parts which are encrypted using three different symmetric cyphers on a round rubin basis. The symmetric cyphers used are DES, AES, and Blowfish. For every file, there are three randomly generated keys corresponding for each of the symmetric cyphers used. These keys are then merged into one file and encrypted using another key called a master key. Both the encrypted file and its encrypted keys file are uploaded to the FTP server while the master key is stored locally on the uploader's device. Every user is granted a pair of public and private keys on registration; these are used for the public key cryptosystem part, specifically RSA. When a user needs to access a certain file, they should send a request to the owner whom may grant or deny access. If access is granted, the owner encrypts the master key using the public key of the reciever before sending it to them. Only the intended reciever can then decrypt the master key using their private key. The reciever can now successfully decrypt the keys file and consequently the resource file. In this desktop application, users can send, recieve, and monitor requests. They can either deny or accept requests. Users can upload files securely and download files they have access to.
